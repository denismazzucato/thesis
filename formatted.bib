In order to build more powerful systems, it is important to understand which systems, and hence which techniques, work well for what types of problems. This paper deals with the empirical evaluation of general purpose ATP systems, to determine which systems work well for what types of problems. This requires also dealing with the issues of assigning ATP problems into classes that are reasonably homogeneous with respect to the ATP systems that (attempt to) solve the problems, and assigning ratings to problems based on their difficulty.}

abstract = {Many security and software testing applications require checking whether certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program’s authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the past four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for a broad audience.},

A recent stream of works showed how abstract interpretation, which is ubiquitously used in static program analysis, can be successfully deployed to formally verify (deep) neural networks. In this work we push forward this line of research by designing a general and principled abstract interpretation-based framework for the formal verification of robustness and stability properties of decision tree ensemble models. Our abstract interpretation-based method may induce complete robustness checks of standard adversarial perturbations and output concrete adversarial attacks. We implemented our abstract verification technique in a tool called silva, which leverages an abstract domain of not necessarily closed real hyperrectangles and is instantiated to verify random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. Our experimental evaluation on the MNIST dataset shows that silva provides a precise and efficient tool which advances the current state of the art in tree ensembles verification.},

   abstract = {We study the problem of formally verifying individual fairness of decision tree ensembles, as well as training tree models which maximize both accuracy and individual fairness. In our approach, fairness verification and fairness-aware training both rely on a notion of stability of a classifier, which is a generalization of the standard notion of robustness to input perturbations used in adversarial machine learning. Our verification and training methods leverage abstract interpretation, a well-established mathematical framework for designing computable, correct, and precise approximations of potentially infinite behaviors. We implemented our fairness-aware learning method by building on a tool for adversarial training of decision trees. We evaluated it in practice on the reference datasets in the literature on fairness in machine learning. The experimental results show that our approach is able to train tree models exhibiting a high degree of individual fairness with respect to the natural state-of-the-art CART trees and random forests. Moreover, as a by-product, these fairness-aware decision trees turn out to be significantly compact, which naturally enhances their interpretability.},
